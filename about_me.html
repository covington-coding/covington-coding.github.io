                <p>My name is Jace, and I am currently in 11th grade, and I have a year and a half of experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</p>
                <p>I own a site that hosts games for the people at my school, and people are constantly talking about it around me</p>
                <p>I don't have anything too crazy to say here, I decided to make this site to help people my age get into coding</p>
                <p>There are OS restrictions, admins not allowing Linux on school chromebooks, missing out on tons of great resources due to blocks, and the first hurdle of coding. Starting.</p>
                <p>I was lucky enough to be reccomended to Operation Spark, a New Orleans based class, on a grant funding from the school board.</p>
                <p>But not everybody can commit two days a week for something like that.</p>
                <p>Or even getting in with limited seats</p>
                <p>I don't believe that technology should be limited by time, as the reason people devote their lives to creating revolutionary software is to make a better world</p>
                <p>Making a place that runs faster and faster, builds on top of itself</p>
                <p>Technology can be an amazing tool, no matter if you just think it looks cool, or are interested in a possible career path</p>
                <p>In school, we have chromebooks, and we have internet</p>
                <p>The only thing keeping you from a bright future is taking the first step</p>
                <p>I only hope that I can help with that</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you are having issues with the examples given, would rather help from me on call, or just have any questions, you can reach me at covington.coding@gmail.com</p>
